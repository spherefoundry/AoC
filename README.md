# Advent of Code - Antoni KÄ™dracki

This repository holds my solutions to Advent Of Code puzzles. My approach prioritises 
speed of development over beauty of code or making the solution optimal :P Or in 
other words: If it works, why overthink it.

## Bootstrap script

For AoC 2024 I decided to remove some strain and automate a bit: 

```
python bootstrap.py -y <year> -d <day>
```

This generates a directory located in `year<year>/day<day>` with:

* placeholder files for example input (`task1_example.txt` and `task2_example.txt`)
* placeholder files for puzzle input (`task1.txt` and `task2.txt`)
* logic files (`task1.py` and `task2.py`) with boilerplate for parsing input files and tests
